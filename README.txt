This project was written by Peter Olsen

Assumptions:
    Flags cannot be removed
    The user will not input integers
    The user does not want to place a flag on their first move, since there will never be a mine in the starting spot.
    (All are specified in the rules, lines 79 - 91)

There are no known bugs in the program, but it will error if you don't enter integers for your guess
